# Automated Integration Testing

## Overview
This repo is an example on how to implement automated integration tests with WebdriveIO

### Assumptions
This repository is windows only as it uses the `.exe` ChromeDriver.

## Getting Started
Using [WebdriverIO](http://webdriver.io/), the `test` script
* Reads the [config file](wdio.conf.js)
* The `onPrepare` call hosts the app locally & starts Chromedriver.exe
* In place of the Chrome binary, `RunOpenFin.bat` is called to pass the remote-debugging-port to the OpenFin runtime
* The hello world test runs
* After the test runs, `.close()` is called on the app
* Install required build tools: `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools`

## Launch
### Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

## Disclaimers
* This is a starter example and intended to demonstrate to app providers a sample of how to approach an implementation. There are potentially other ways to approach it and alternatives could be considered. 
* Its possible that the repo is not actively maintained.
